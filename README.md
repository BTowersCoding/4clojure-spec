# 4clojure-spec
Rebooting 4clojure with generative testing

## Rationale

4clojure's teaching style is centered around unit (example-based) testing.

This is good, because:

* It prepares the student for test-driven design

This is bad, because:

* It prepares the student for test-driven design

What if we kept the same problems and learning path, but instead of presenting the user with a list of examples with blanks to fill in, show them a spec and be challenged to write a function which satisfies the spec.

What I'm talking about is rewriting the unit tests as specs. I guess I'll get started.
